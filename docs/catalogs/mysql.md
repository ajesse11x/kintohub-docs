## Overview

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is the worldâ€™s most popular open source database. With its proven performance, reliability, and ease-of-use, MySQL has become the leading database choice for web-based applications, used by high profile web properties.

## Deployment

- This takes around 3 minutes to deploy
- **You can deploy Mysql with default environment variables*

## FAQ

**Q: Why the deployment fails?**  
A: Check the environment variable `resources.memory`. Provide at least 512MB memory.
