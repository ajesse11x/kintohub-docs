## Deployment

- This takes around 3 minutes to deploy
- **You can deploy this catalog with default environment variables*

## FAQ

**Q: Why the deployment fails?**  
A: Check the environment variable `resources.requests.memory`, `resources.limit.memory` and the memory of the block are equal. Provide at least 512MB memory.

**Q: Why cannot connect to mysql?**  
A: Copy the connection string by clicking `Connect` button. Only blocks that are deployed in the same environment can connect to the catalog.
